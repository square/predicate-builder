<!--Latest Release-->
## [1.0.2] - 09-22-2023

### Fixed
- Fixed representation of optional comparison values in the resulting format string. Optionals will now correctly be represented as `"nil"` instead of `<null>`

## [1.0.1] - 09-19-2023

### Fixed
- Removed a crash on comparison of an Optional key path to `nil`

## [1.0.0] - 07-19-2023

### Added
- Result builder-based DSL for declarative predicate composition
- DSL types
  - `Value`, `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `AnyMembers`, `NoMembers`
- String comparisons
  - `like`, `starts(with:)`, `ends(with:)`, `in`
- Collection operations
  - `contains(_:)`
- Predicate literals
  - `true`, `false`, `NSPredicate` (for composing custom prdicates using an expression string for a predicate type that does not yet exist in the DSL)
- Operators
  - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`

- `#PredicateBuilder` macro for Swift 5.9 users
- Disallow `Foundation.Predicate` types in the DSL
  - While in beta at the time of writing, the `#Predicate` macro does not offer as much type safety when converting itself to `NSPredicate`--and contains some of the same runtime crash pitfalls as the string-based predicate expression language. This restriction will be re-evaluated when Swift 5.9 is fully-released.
- Allow `TypedPredicate` types to be constructed with a key path which is agnostic about the optionality of its `Value`
- Constrain the builder to `NSManagedObject` subclasses.
  - This allows for enhanced type safety over the previous `NSObject` constraint, as `@NSManaged` stored properties are guaranteed to be operable with the predicate expression language
